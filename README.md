Eight Challenge for Bootcamp in web-developing and UX

This was the eight challenge for the University of Birmingham bootcamp in front-end web-developing and UX. In this challenge, I had to create a simple weather dashboard. I also needed to use the [Day.js](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format) library to work with date and time.


## Acceptance Criteria

* Create a weather dashboard with form inputs.
  * When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
  * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
  * When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
